# Accessibility Options

Making Osopcloud accessible is a big priority for our team.

We've implemented a handful of accessibility settings, which are described below. We plan to implement more in the future.

## Font

The app uses a custom font. To enable or disable this behaviour, use Settings:

1. Go to Settings.
2. Enable (or disable) "Use System Font".

## Motion

To reduce animations across the app, configure your operating system accessibility settings. Look for a toggle to "reduce motion" or "reduce animations" and enable it.

## Keyboard

### Keyboard Shortcuts

Osopcloud implements a set of keyboard shortcuts. These use character-keys only, so they could cause conflicts with the other shortcuts on your system.

To enable or disable character-only keyboard shortcuts, use Settings:

1. Go to Settings.
2. Enable (or disable) "Disable Character-Only Keyboard Shortcuts".

### Tab Button

The `tab` button on your keyboard can be used to go through buttons, links, and other input elements, starting at sidebar or header. To select that button, press `enter` or `return`.
