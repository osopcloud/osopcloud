# Exporting from the Osopcloud Composer

First, thank you for your interest in contributing to the Osopcloud project!

Once you've finished working on an Osopcloud Composer work, you need to get it onto our GitHub source repository.

Osopcloud itself is open-source and so the way to get new content onto the platform is through GitHub. Open a pull request, wait a few days, and you're new OS will be live.

> You need a free GitHub account to contribute.

## Exporting with GitHub

The easiest way to get your work on to our Git source repository is to use the GitHub web interface.

This is actually very easy. To get started:

1. Select "Export and Share" to bring up the export options.
2. Select "Continue on GitHub".

This will then bring up the web interface in a new tab. Now:

1. Fill in the file name field. Use the file name shown on the export options menu.
2. Paste in the code from the Composer within the text area. The Composer will have automatically copied the code to the clipboard.
3. Select "Create a New Branch for this Commit".
4. Name the branch.
5. Select "Propose New File".

## Exporting without GitHub

If you want to work with the file locally, add into a local development build, or publish to Git using your own toolchain, you can also export without using the GitHub web interface.

To show these options, select "Export and Share" and then "Export as a File Instead".

Here you can:

- **Share `.json` File**: This Share Point exports the project to your apps and friends.
- **Save `.json` File**: This saves the JSON file locally on your computer. You can save to your development folder, downloads, or any other location on your disks.
- **Export Text to Clipboard**: This exports raw JSON text to the system clipboard.

From here you can use your local environment to merge the code into the repository.

> You should use the Git `--signoff` CLI flag. This acknowledges that you agree to contribution policies.
