## Starting a Project

### Create a New Operating System Page

Adding a new open-source operating system to Osopcloud is easy.

1. Open Osopcloud Composer by using the plus icon button in the sidebar or header.
2. Enter the name of the operating system.

When you're finished, select "Export and Share". _See below._

### Edit an Existing Operating System

It's also easy to import an existing operating system into Osopcloud Composer. Use this model if you want to edit existing content, or build off an existing OS.

1. Go to the operating system on Osopcloud.
2. In it's Operating System Page, select "Open in Composer".
3. If you're already working on something in Osopcloud Composer, you will be prompted if you want to override your work with this OS. Select "Continue & Reset".

<summary>Building Off an OS to Implement it's Variant</summary>

Let's say there's an already OS on Osopcloud. But, then, a new OS comes onto the market with very similar characteristics. They share the same desktop, shell, package managers, startup frameworks, etc. A real-life example of this might be Ubuntu and Ubuntu MATE, or Fedora and Fedora Silverblue.

The pattern editing existing operating systems allows us to "build off" or "fork" something that's already on Osopcloud and create something new.

First, follow the steps above to edit an existing operating system. Then, simply:

1. Select the operating system's name, and replace it with your new name.
2. Change the description.
3. Change the website and source repository.
4. Then edit everything else that is specific to that OS!

## Working with Osopcloud Composer

Osopcloud Composer is designed to be easy to use.

To simplify editing, the description and metadata are combined on the same editing pane.

> A description, tags, platforms, what the OS is based on, and a website URL are required.

### Description

The description is an expository paragraph describing the quirks, features, and details of the operating system. The goal of descriptions are to provide sufficient overviews, or, in other words, the perfect place for a beginner to start learning about that OS.

To edit the description, select on the textarea at the top of the editor.

> On devices with a mouse, you can adjust the height of the textarea by moving your cursor to the textarea border and dragging vertically.

### Metadata

The metadata table is also easily configurable.

Some columns on the table are single-value items. This applies to metadata fields for which operating systems only have one value (for example, an operating system's startup framework). For these, select the text in the column (or "Click to Edit...") to make changes.

Other columns accept multiple values. Select the column's plus icon button, then type in or select a value, and click the add button.

> Like in OS Pages, metadata items with multiple values are automatically sorted alphabetically.

> The first tag of an OS gets priority throughout the interface.

### Website & Source repository

To configure the operating systems's website and source repository links, select "Edit Website & Repository" from the editor sidebar. Simply select the text in the column to set them.

> URLs must include `https://`.

## Exporting

Once you are done, we need to get your work onto the Osopcloud GitHub source repository. See Exporting from Osopcloud Composer to learn how.
