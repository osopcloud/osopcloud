# Operating System Pages

At the heart of Osopcloud are Operating System Pages. Each open-source operating system on the Osopcloud platform gets it's own space for descriptions, metadata, and more.

## Starting your Discovery

The way to find operating systems on Osopcloud is through Home. Home includes:

- The **Operating System List**: This lists all operating systems on Osopcloud. You can sort them by name, or group them by metadata categories.
- **Search**: Quickly find an OS by it's name with Search on Home.

## The Components of an Operating System Page

Each Operating System Page (or "OS Page") is broken down into key areas.

On the top or on the right you can toggle between the Description tab and the Metadata & More tab.

### Descriptions

Descriptions for operating systems are a paragraph describing the quirks, features, and details of the operating system. Read through descriptions to get an excellent overview of an OS. Then, select "Open Project Website" and visit the project's website to learn even more.

> If the description, includes the footnote "This content presented by ...", it means the content has been written by a member of the organisation listed. To learn more, see About Osopcloud for Organisations.

### Metadata

Each operating system includes a comprehensive metadata table inside of the Metadata & More tab. Explore tabular columns including desktop, shell, package managers, startup framework, authors, and more. Go here to get a rapid overview of an OS.

> Select an author with a linked @ username to see their GitHub profile.

### Links

Also on Operating System Pages are links. With this, you can quickly visit the operating system's website or their public source repository. Or, open the OS in the Osopcloud Composer.

Donation options are also in the works.
