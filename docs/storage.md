# About Storage and Application Data

With Storage on Osopcloud, your Settings and works in Osopcloud Composer persist after you close your current session. You can come back to Osopcloud tomorrow and each of these will be the same.

Storage is stored by your web browser. If you've installed Osopcloud as an app, this is the web browser that's "hosting" the app.

<summary>About Osopcloud Storage Usage</summary>

In addition to storing Osopcloud Composer data and Settings Osopcloud automatically downloads content in the background. This lets you use the app without a network connection.

On compatible browsers, you can find a storage usage estimate in Settings. Sometimes this can be quite large.

There's a couple of factors that impact this size measure:

- There's no limit on how big the cache can get
- The cache is specific to each browser
- Some older browsers don't delete caches for previous versions

So, if you use Osopcloud across many browsers, you may get into a situation where Osopcloud is storing more than 100 megabytes on a single device. You will need to use your browser settings if you want to clear caches.
