# Osopcloud Privacy Statement

Thank you for using the Osopcloud Web Application (the "Application").

Osopcloud ("Osopcloud", "we") has, along with entities other than Osopcloud (each a "Third-Party"), a responsibility to protect and safeguard your privacy and data.

This Privacy Statement (the "Statement") describes how Osopcloud collects, uses, and discloses information about you and your use of the Application. By using the Application, you agree to the terms of this Statement, which are effective as of June 30, 2022.

## 1. Data Collection and Use

Each of the following sections describes how Osopcloud and the Application collects information about you and your use of the Application.

### 1.1 Aggregate Tracking Data

- the date and time of your use of the Application,
- the amount of time you spend on pages,
- and details about website or application that sent you to the Application, if applicable.

Aggregate Tracking Data collection systems are designed to only collect Aggregate Tracking Data if:

- determine market demand,
- improve the security of the Application,
- enforce the license(s) of the Application,
- and protect Osopcloud's or a Third-Party's rights, intellectual property, or legal obligations.

Because the Aggregate Tracking Data has minimal privacy impact, and is neccessary for legal reasons, it is considered in Osopcloud's legitimate interest to collect Aggregate Tracking Data.

Aggregate Tracking Data may be shared with a Third-Party engaged in the purchase of the Application, and transferred to that Third-Party in the event of a change in ownership.

Osopcloud may share the data we have collected if required by law, or if we believe that such action is necessary to comply with the law or to protect Osopcloud's rights or intellectual property, or in the event of a court order or subpoena.

Aggregate Tracking Data is stored indefinently.

Technical Data is not sent to Osopcloud and is discarded naturally.
