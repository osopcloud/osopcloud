## Accessibility

Making Osopcloud accessible is a big priority for our team.

We've implemented a handful of accessibility features, which are described below. We plan to implement more in the future.

### Font

The app uses a custom font. To enable or disable this behaviour, use Settings:

1. Go to Settings.
2. Select "Accessibility".
3. Enable (or disable) "Use System Font".

### Switch Labels

Switches indicate whether a setting is enabled or disabled. They work like checkboxes. To make it clearer if the switch is on or off, you can enable switch labels.

1. Go to Settings.
2. Select "Accessibility".
3. Enable (or disable) "Show Labels on Switches".

### Motion

To reduce animations across the app, configure your operating system accessibility settings. Look for a toggle to "reduce motion" or "reduce animations" and enable it.

### Tab Button

The `tab` button on your keyboard can be used to go through buttons, links, and other input elements, starting at sidebar or header. To select that button, press `enter` or `return`.
