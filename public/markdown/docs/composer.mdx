## Osopcloud Composer

The Osopcloud Composer feature makes it easy to create, edit and publish Operating System Pages.

### Create a New Operating System Page

If you want to add a new open-source operating system to Osopcloud, open the Composer by selecting the plus button from the header or sidebar.

1. When prompted, enter the operating system's name.
2. Edit the description by selecting "Click to edit the description...".
3. Edit each row in the metadata table by selecting "Click to edit..." or the plus button.
4. Open "Edit Website and Repository" and fill in the website and repository information.

When you're finished, select "Export and Share". _See below._

### Edit an Existing Operating System Page

If you want to edit an existing Operating System Page, go to the Operating System Page and select Open in Composer. The operating system's information will then be imported to the Composer and the Composer will be opened.

### Exporting from the Composer with GitHub

We need to get what we've done in the Composer onto the Osopcloud GitHub repository and onto the web.

When you're finished editing the operating system, select "Export and Share" to bring up the export options.

The recommended approach is to select "Continue on GitHub". This will take you to the GitHub web editing interface:

1. Fill in the file name field. Use the file name shown on the export options menu.
2. Paste in the code from the Composer within the text area. The Composer will have automatically copied the code to the clipboard.
3. Select "Create a New Branch for this Commit".
4. Name the branch.
5. Select "Propose New File".

### Exporting without GitHub

First, select "Export and Share". By selecting "Export as a File Instead", you can also share or download a packaged `.json` file, or copy the code without going to GitHub. From here you can use your local environment to merge the code into the repository.

### Resetting the Composer and Managing Composer Data

To start over, select "Reset" from the Composer header. You will lose your work.

Alternatively, you can use the "Reset Osopcloud" function in Settings. Because Composer data is stored alongside Settings data, you can also use the Import and Export features to transfer your work between browsers and devices.
