## Getting Started

Welcome to Osopcloud!

### Navigating

First let's plot out how to get around. On mobile and smaller windows, you can navigate with the header. On larger windows, you can use the sidebar.

### The Four Sections

There are four main sections of the app:

- **Home:** The home screen. Home includes search and the operating system list. Go Home to search Osopcloud and discover something new.
- **Operating System Pages:** Operating System Pages describe an open-source operating system. They include a description, links, metadata, and more.
- **Composer:** The Osopcloud Composer makes it easy to create Operating System Pages. Go to the Composer to create and edit Operating System Pages.
- **Settings:** Go to Settings to customise and configure Osopcloud.

Other than these sections there is this documentation and legal notices.
