## Settings

With Settings, you can customise and configure Osopcloud.

Settings are stored on your device and remain the same every time you use Osopcloud.

To open Settings, select the gear icon button in the header or sidebar.

### Search Settings

To search for a setting, troubleshooter, or action, type it's name in the "Search Settings" bar. This will take you to where the setting is located.

### Import or Export Settings

If you need to take your Settings to another browser or device, use Osopcloud's built-in Settings import and export features.

To export your settings, select "Application Storage" and then select "Export Storage Data to Clipboard". This will copy a JSON string to your clipboard which you can paste into a file or send to another device.

To import settings, select "Application Storage" and then select "Import Storage from Clipboard". If prompted, select "Allow" or "Paste" to import the settings. The imported settings will overwrite your current settings.

**Note:** When you use the Import Storage from Clipboard feature, your full clipboard is revealed to the application. If there's no settings data in the clipboard, the import will fail.

**Important:** It isn't possible to import settings on Mozilla Firefox.

### Reset Osopcloud

To restore the default settings, select "Application Storage" and then the "Reset Osopcloud" option. This will also reset Osopcloud Composer.
