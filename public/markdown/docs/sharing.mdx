## Apps, Share Points, and Printing

### Share Points

Across Osopcloud, there are buttons that show a share icon or the "Share" label. These are called Share Points.

When you select a Share Point, the native share sheet appears. This allows you to share Osopcloud pages and content with the other apps on your system, or with your friends.

### Printing on Osopcloud

If you need to print on Osopcloud, take advantage of the app's built-in printing enhancements.

You can add a dedicated print button to the sidebar in Settings. When you select the app's print button, or use the Command+P or Control+P shortcut, the Dynamic Printing feature kicks in.

Dynamic Printing automatically hides the layout before bringing up the print dialog.

To print the full page, including the layout, use the browser print option, or enable "Disable Dynamic Printing" in Settings.
